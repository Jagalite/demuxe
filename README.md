# Deplexr

Deplexr is a browser media playback runtime that automatically chooses the least
expensive correct playback path: native browser playback, progressive remuxing,
WebCodecs-assisted hybrid playback, or FFmpeg/mpv software decoding.

The three public modes are **native**, **hybrid**, and **software**. Remuxing is
part of Native, not a fourth mode. This is a developer beta with representative
Chrome/Firefox evidence, not a promise of universal codec or browser support.

## Install

```sh
npm install deplexr@beta
npx deplexr copy-assets public/assets/deplexr
```

Serve the copied directory at `/assets/deplexr/`, preserving its relative tree.
Native remux, Hybrid, and Software require cross-origin isolation headers:

```text
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

Native direct playback does not require Wasm or isolation. Remote sources need
appropriate CORS and range support. See [runtime assets](docs/RUNTIME-ASSETS.md).

## Core runtime

```js
import { Player } from 'deplexr';

const player = new Player(container, { assetBase: '/assets/deplexr/' });
await player.open(source); // File, ArrayBuffer, URL, or supported remote source
await player.play();
// When finished: await player.destroy();
```

## Ready-made player

```js
import { definePlayerElement } from 'deplexr/player';
definePlayerElement();
```

```html
<deplexr-player controls asset-base="/assets/deplexr/"></deplexr-player>
```

The component includes local-file and URL opening, subtitles, playback controls,
keyboard shortcuts, and optional session diagnostics. Local files stay in the
browser. The runtime never uploads them.

See [the public API](docs/PUBLIC-API.md), [component contract](docs/PLAYER-COMPONENT.md),
[migration notes](docs/API-MIGRATION.md), and [beta limits](docs/BETA.md).

## Release and licensing

The repository root is intentionally `private: true` and cannot be published to
npm. `scripts/package-beta.py` assembles the publishable package; only the exact
verified release tarball is published, with the `beta` dist-tag. See
[the release procedure](docs/RELEASE.md).

The combined package is GPL-2.0-or-later. Preserve the license, dependency notices,
and matching source companion when distributing the runtime. See
[licensing](docs/LICENSING.md). Safari/mobile, physical HDR/surround, PiP/casting,
and broad device/performance qualification remain follow-up work.

## Develop

From the source checkout, run `npm ci`, build the engines using
[the release recipe](docs/RELEASE.md), then run `npm run build` and `npm run dev`.
