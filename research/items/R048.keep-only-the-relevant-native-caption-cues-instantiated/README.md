# Keep only the relevant native caption cues instantiated

Full identity: `R048.keep-only-the-relevant-native-caption-cues-instantiated`. Reused R-numbers are separate mechanisms.

Current imported decision: **PURSUE** (top100).

Actual10000-cue native TextTrack versus at-most22 materialized cues yields identical active cue text at6 forward/backward seeks, including near end. Removing active cue detected. Native cue-object count reduced; total memory/CPU benefit and API-compatible player adapter unqualified.

Next action: Read the supplied local follow-up and verify the named raw record once if accessible. Carry forward its scoped disposition; do not rerun this profile just to populate this ledger. Real large-cue overhead plus a bounded API-compatible design; do not re-open the explained boundary mismatch as a bug.

## Definition and contract

New subtitle memory/startup optimization · P1 · PROPOSED / NOT TESTED Question. Can large simple-caption tracks remain Native without creating every browser cue object before playback? Mechanism. Keep a bounded logical text/interval index and instantiate VTTCue objects only for the current window, including every cue overlapping its edges. Evict unneeded native objects, not the underlying subtitle text or transcript semantics. Smallest useful experiment. Generate 10,000 simple cues with overlaps, Unicode and several long cues. Compare eager insertion with an indexed moving window. Exercise distant/backward seeks, pause on a boundary, rate changes, hide/show and source replacement. Ensure the required cues are present before the new presentation becomes visible.

Output contract: Independent rendering or browser-owned reference appropriate to the same contract, including hidden state, timing, ordering and clear events.

Primary metric: Required caption capability or total render/extraction cost and retained cue/atlas memory.

Adverse control: Seek into an active cue, change fonts/layout/source, or omit a required style/control. No silent simplification or stale overlay.

## Stages

| Stage | Status | Basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| define | passed | Existing source-grounded definition imported; acceptance criteria must be reviewed before a new run. |
| prepare | pending | Historical evidence retained; stage-specific acceptance has not been reconciled into this checklist. |
| screen | passed | Historical bounded screening disposition recorded. This is completion of screening, not candidate correctness. |
| correctness | pending | Historical evidence retained; stage-specific acceptance has not been reconciled into this checklist. |
| performance | pending | Historical evidence retained; stage-specific acceptance has not been reconciled into this checklist. |
| results | passed | Existing results indexed with current byte identities; historical mismatches are separately retained in the migration record. |
| decision | passed | Historical decision imported verbatim: PURSUE. No integration or qualification inferred. |

Pending preparation/correctness/performance means the historical evidence has not
been converted into a stage acceptance record; it does not erase historical passes
or require rerunning them. Read the evidence before updating these fields.

## Working files

- [Item state and original definition](item.json): authoritative current metadata; update this README when changing it.
- [Decision history](history.jsonl): imported records and their exact ledger locations; append future decisions.
- [Evidence index](evidence/index.json): paths, hashes, and historical hash declarations.
- [Research process](../../PROCESS.md): run layout, gates, fixture and license requirements.

Create `tests/` and `fixtures/` only when this item needs its own code or data.
Shared historical harnesses remain in `tests/` at repository root; commands and
fixture references are in the linked evidence. No unverified harness-to-item
association was invented during migration.
